# Github Pages Deployment
A simple GitHub Actions [workflow](https://github.com/tedleyem/roadmap-projects/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml) to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages. 

## Local Development 

 **Install Jekyll and Bundler Locally**
  ```
  ./build.sh
  ```

 **Open your browser and navigate to**
  ```
  http://localhost:4000
  ```

This project is part of [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow) project.
